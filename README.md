> What is Containerization?  

Containerization is the process of distributing and deploying applications in a portable and predictable way. It accomplishes this by packaging components and their dependencies into standardized, isolated, lightweight process environments called containers that can be easily deployed to distributed systems, allowing the system to scale easily and survive machine and application failures.  
Docker is the most common containerization software in use today
